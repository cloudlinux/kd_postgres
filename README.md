This is the fork of official image for postgres.
The difference is an optional auto memory configuration feature:
Define environment variable for the container *PG_AUTO_MEMORY_CONFIG=yes* and if
there is a memory limit for the container, then will be created additional
configuration file $PGDATA/auto_memory_config.conf.
It defines *max_connections*, *shared_buffers*. *effective_cache_size*
parameters according to memory limit in the container.
